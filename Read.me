# Android App Project

This is a basic Android app project structure. Below, you'll find a brief description of each file and directory in this project:

## app

This directory contains the main source code for your Android application. Most of your Java/Kotlin code, layout XML files, and resources (such as images and strings) are placed here.

## gradle/wrapper

This directory contains the Gradle Wrapper, which is a script that allows you to run the Gradle build system without installing Gradle globally on your system. It includes files like `gradle-wrapper.properties` and the JAR file `gradle-wrapper.jar`.

## build.gradle

This is the project-level build file. It defines project-wide settings and dependencies. You can specify Gradle plugins, repositories, and other configurations here.

## gradle.properties

This file can contain project-specific Gradle properties. It's often used to store sensitive information like API keys.

## gradlew and gradlew.bat

These are scripts for running Gradle tasks on Unix-like systems and Windows, respectively. You can use these scripts to build, test, and package your Android app.

## local.properties

This file is automatically generated by Android Studio and should not be checked into version control. It contains local configuration settings such as the location of the Android SDK on your machine.

## settings.gradle

This file defines the structure of your Android project. It lists the modules (e.g., "app") that are part of your project.

## test_sl_android.iml

This is an IntelliJ IDEA module file that helps configure your project's settings for the IDE.

Feel free to add more sections or details to your README file depending on the specifics of your Android project. You can include information about how to build, run, and contribute to the project, as well as any other relevant details.
